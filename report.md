#### NOTE
- do `make all dim=3D` for 3D graphics else do `make all` for 2D graphics.
- Some `Safety` parameters are present in the Config file which should always be present.
- The terminal output is printed in `output.txt`.
- The camera can be moved in 3D graphical version using keys:
  - `W -> view up`
  - `S -> view down`
  - `A -> view left`
  - `D -> view right`
  - `Z -> zoom in`
  - `X -> zoom out`
  - `R -> reset everything`
  - Arrow keys -> movement.
- 3D graphics are Perspective view whereas 2D graphics are orthogonal view.
- As we have done the whole simulation with very small sampling rate. So many times the vehicles positions are not exactly integers and thus are not very accurate in the terminal output.
