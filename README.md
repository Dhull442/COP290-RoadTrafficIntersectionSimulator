# Traffic light Simulator 

This is a configurable program to simulate traffic behavior near a traffic signal. It is written from scratch in OpenGL and supports both 2D and 3D visualizations. The simulation is driven by a `.ini` configuration file which can specify the driving behavior of individual cars and the traffic signal timing.
